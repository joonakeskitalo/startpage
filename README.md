# Start page

## What?

Having commonly used links available on a single page is useful, since then you can search them with cmd/ctrl+f, change browsers easier without having to import/export bookmarks (or still have links left after browser has corrupted).

## How?

- Clone this repository or download either `index.html` or `index_plain.html`
- Add your own links
- Set the file as the homepage for your browser

You can also create your own and this is just a simple template for the concept.
